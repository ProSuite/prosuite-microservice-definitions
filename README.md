# prosuite-microservice-definitions
Defines ProSuite's [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc) microservice APIs for servers and clients implemented in different repositories.

The ProSuite microservices are designed to make existing (ArcObjects-based) functionality, such as quality verification or feature manipulation, available to various clients (ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, command line applications, etc.).

The microservice APIs are defined by the gRPC proto files in this repository. Building the solution will produce the assemblies / Nuget packages that can be consumed by client or server implementers.
