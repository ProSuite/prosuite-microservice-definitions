# ProSuite QA Microservice Definitions

[ProSuite QA](https://dirageosystems.ch/prosuite) provides quality verification functionality for geographic data implemented in a microservice architecture. 
This package contains the .NET assemblies of the [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc) microservice APIs for the QA servers and clients implemented in different repositories.

In case the other ProSuite Microservice Definitions are used in the same application, make sure to use corresponding versions, as they have a shared reference.

## Versioning

We plan to use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning once version 1.0 is released. For the moment we do not guarantee any kind of compatibility, so make sure the client and server implementations use the same package version.
